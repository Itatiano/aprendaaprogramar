      Quando você programa um computador, você tem que "falar" em 
      uma lingua que o seu computador entenda: uma linguagem de 
      programação. Existem muitas e muitas linguagens por aí, e muitas 
      são excelentes. Neste tutorial eu escolhí usar a minha favorita, 
      o <em>Ruby</em>.

    #  When you program a computer, you have to "speak" in a
    #  language your computer understands:  a programming
    #  language.  There are lots and lots of different
    #  languages out there, and many of them are excellent.
    #  In this tutorial I chose to use my favorite
    #  programming language, <em>Ruby</em>.

      Além de ser a minha favorita, o Ruby também a linguagem mais
      fácil que eu já vi (e eu já ví uma bela quantidade delas). Aliás,
      esta é a verdadeira razão pela qual estou escrevendo este tutorial:
      Eu não decidí escrever este tutorial e aí escolhí Ruby por ser minha favorita;
      ao invés disso, eu descobrí que o Ruby era tão fácil que eu decidí
      que deveria haver um bom tutorial para iniciantes que usasse ela.
      É a simplicidade do Ruby que inspirou este tutorial, não o fato que ela é
      a minha favorita.
      (Escrever um tutorial similar usando outra linguagem, C++ ou Java, teria tomado
      centenas e centenas de páginas.) Mas não pense que o Ruby seja uma linguagem
      para iniciantes só porque é fácil! Ela é uma linguagem poderosa, de nível profissional
      como poucas.

    #  Aside from being my favorite,
    #  Ruby is also the easiest programming language I have seen
    #  (and I've seen quite a few).  In fact, that's the real
    #  reason I'm writing this tutorial:  I didn't decide to write
    #  a tutorial, and then choose Ruby because it's my favorite;
    #  instead, I found Ruby to be so easy that I decided there
    #  really ought to be a good beginner's tutorial which uses
    #  it.  It's Ruby's simplicity which prompted this tutorial,
    #  not the fact that it's my favorite.
    #  (Writing a similar tutorial using
    #  another language, like C++ or Java, would have required
    #  hundreds and hundreds of pages.)  But don't think that
    #  Ruby is a beginner's language just because it is easy!
    #  It is a powerful, professional-strength programming
    #  language if ever there was one.

      Quando você escreve algo em uma linguagem humana, o que é escrito
      é chamado de texto. Quando você escreve algo em uma linguagem de 
      computador, o que é escrito é chamado de <dfn>código</dfn>. Eu incluí
      vários examplos de código Ruby por todo este tutorial, a maioria 
      deles programas completos que você pode rodar no seu próprio
      computador. Para deixar o código mais legível, eu colorí partes dele
      com cores diferentes. (Por exemplo, números são sempre
      <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">#{@@NUMBER_COLOR}</span></span>.)
      Qualquer coisa que você tiver que digitar estará sempre em a 
      #{input @@INPUT_DESC}, e qualquer coisa que o programa imprimir
      estará em um #{output @@OUTPUT_DESC}.

    #  When you write something in a human language, what is

    #  have included lots of examples of Ruby code throughout
    #  this tutorial, most of them complete programs you can
    #  run on your own computer.  To make the code easier to
    #  read, I have colored parts of the code different
    #  colors.  (For example, numbers are always
    #  <span class="L2Pcode"><span class="L2Pnumber">#{@@NUMBER_COLOR}</span></span>.)
    #  Anything you are supposed to type in will be in a

      If you come across something you don't understand, or you
      have a question which wasn't answered, write it down and
      keep reading!  It's quite possible that the answer will
      come in a later chapter.  However, if your question was
      not answered by the last chapter, I will tell you where
      you can go to ask it.  There are lots of wonderful people
      out there more than willing to help; you just need to know
      where they are.

      But first we need to download and install Ruby onto your
      computer.

    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The Windows installation of Ruby is a breeze.  First, you
      need to download the
      <a href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/">Ruby installer</a>.
      There might be a couple of versions to choose from; this tutorial
      is using version #{RUBY_VERSION}, so make sure what you download is at
      least as recent as that.  (I would just get the latest
      version available.)  Then simply run the installation program.
      It will ask you where you want to install Ruby.  Unless you have
      a good reason for it, I would just install it in the default
      location.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      In order to program, you need to be able to write programs and
      to run programs.  To do this, you will need a text editor and a
      command line.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      The Ruby installer comes with a lovely text editor called SciTE
      (the Scintilla Text Editor).  You can run SciTE by selecting it
      from the start menu.  If you would like your code to be colored
      like the examples in this tutorial, download these files and
      put them in your SciTE folder (<kbd>c:/ruby/scite</kbd> if you chose the
      default location):
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    ul do
      li {'<a href="'+LINKADDR+'SciTEGlobal.properties">Global Properties</a>'}
      li {'<a href="'+LINKADDR+'ruby.properties">Ruby Properties</a>'}
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      It would also be a good idea to create a folder somewhere to keep
      all of your programs.  Make sure that when you save a program,
      you save it into this folder.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      To get to your command line, select Command Prompt from the
      Accessories folder in your start menu.  You will want to
      navigate to the folder where you are keeping your programs.
      Typing #{input 'cd ..'} will take you up one folder, and
      #{input 'cd foldername'} would put you inside the folder
      named <kbd>foldername</kbd>.  To see all of the folders
      in your current folder, type #{input 'dir /ad'}.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And that's it!  You're all set to

      If you have Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), then you already have
      Ruby on your system!  What could be easier?
      Unfortunately, I don't think you can use Ruby on Mac OS X 10.1 and earlier.

      In order to program, you need to be able to write programs and
      to run programs.  To do this, you will need a text editor and a
      command line.
      END_PARAGRAPH

      Your command line is accessible through the Terminal
      application (found in Applications/Utilities).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      For a text editor, you can use whatever one you are familiar
      or comfortable with.  If you use TextEdit, however, make sure
      you save your programs as text-only!  Otherwise your programs
      <em>will not work</em>.  Other options for programming are
      emacs, vi, and pico, which are all accessible from the
      command line.
      END_PARAGRAPH

      First, you will want to check and see if you have Ruby installed
      already.  Type #{input 'which ruby'}.  If it says something like
      #{output '/usr/bin/which: no ruby in (...)'}, then you need to
      <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20020102.html">download Ruby</a>,
      otherwise see what version of Ruby you are running with
      #{input 'ruby -v'}.  If it is older than the latest stable build
      on the above download page, you might want to upgrade.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      If you are the root user, then you probably don't need any
      instructions for installing Ruby.  If you aren't, you might want
      to ask your system administrator to install it for you.  (That way
      everyone on that system could use Ruby.)
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Otherwise, you can just install it so that only you can use it.
      Move the file you downloaded to a temporary directory, like
      <kbd>$HOME/tmp</kbd>.  If the name of the file is
      <kbd>ruby-1.6.7.tar.gz</kbd>, you can open it with
      #{input 'tar zxvf ruby-1.6.7.tar.gz'}.  Change directory
      to the directory you just created (in this example,
      #{input 'cd ruby-1.6.7'}).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Configure your installation by typing
      #{input './configure --prefix=$HOME'}).  Next type
      #{input 'make'}, which will build your Ruby interpreter.
      This might take a few minutes.  After that is done, type
      #{input 'make install'} to install it.
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      Next, you'll want to add <kbd>$HOME/bin</kbd> to your
      command search path by editing your <kbd>$HOME/.bashrc</kbd>
      file.  (You might have to log out and back in again for
      this to take effect.)  After you do that, test your installation:
      #{input 'ruby -v'}.  If that tells you what version of Ruby you
      have, you can now delete the files
      in <kbd>$HOME/tmp</kbd> (or wherever you put them).
      END_PARAGRAPH
    end
    para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
      And that's it!  You're all set to
