              Eu acho que tudo isso come&ccedil;ou em 2002. Eu estava pensando
              em ensinar programa&ccedil;&atilde;o, e como uma grande linguagem como
              Ruby seria &oacute;tima para aprender a como programar.  Quer dizer, n&oacute;s est&aacute;vamos
              todos excitados com Ruby pelo seu poder, eleg&acirc;ncia e por ser realmente divertido,
              mas me pareceu que ele seria, tamb&eacute;m um excelente guia para aprender a programar.

              Infelizmente, n&atilde;o havia muita documenta&ccedil;&atilde;o sobre Ruby
              destinada aos iniciantes, naquela &eacute;poca. Alguns de n&oacute;s,
              na comunidade, est&aacute;vamos falando sobre como um tutorial 
              "Ruby for the Nuby" era necess&aacute;rio,
              e, mais gen&eacute;ricamente, um tutorial ensinando a programar, como um todo.
              Quanto mais eu pensava nisso, mais eu tinha a dizer (o que me surpreendeu
              um pouco). At&aacute; que algu&eacute;m finalmente disse: &quot;Chris, porque voc&ecirc;
              n&atilde;o escreve um tutorial ao inv&eacute;s de ficar falando sobre isso?&quot;.
              Ent&atilde;o eu o fiz.

              And it wasn't very good.  I had all these ideas that were good
              <em>in theory</em>, but the actual task of making a great
              tutorial for non-programmers was vastly more challenging than
              I had realized.  (I mean, it seemed good to me, but I already
              knew how to program.)

              What saved me was that I made it really easy for people to
              contact me, and I always tried to help people when they got
              stuck.  When I saw a lot of people getting stuck in one place,
              I'd rewrite it.  It was a lot of work, but it slowly got better
              and better.

              A couple of years later, it was getting pretty good.  :-)  So
              good, in fact, that I was ready to pronounce it finished, and
              move on to something else.  And right about then came an
              opportunity to turn the tutorial into a book.  Since it was
              already basically done, I figured this would be no problem.
              I'd just clean up a few spots, add some more exercises, maybe
              some more examples, a few more chapters, run it by 50 more
              reviewers...

              There were a few guiding principles that I tried to stick to.
              I think they make the learning process much smoother;
              learning to program is hard enough as it is.  If you're
              teaching or guiding someone on the road to hackerdom, these
              ideas might help you, too.

            end
            para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
              First, I tried to separate concepts as much as possible,
              so that the student would only have to learn
              one concept at a time.  This was difficult at first, but a little
              <em>too</em> easy after I had some practice.  Some things must be
              taught before others, but I was amazed at how little of
              a precedence hierarchy there really is.  Eventually, I just had to
              pick an order, and I tried to arrange things so that each
              new section was motivated by the previous ones.

            end
            para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
              Another principle I've kept in mind is to teach only one way
              to do something.  It's an obvious benefit in a tutorial for
              people who have never programmed before.  For one thing,
              one way to do something is easier to learn than two.  Perhaps
              the more important benefit, though, is that the fewer things
              you teach a new programmer, the more creative and clever
              they have to be in their programming.  Since so much of programming
              is problem solving, it's crucial to encourage that as much
              as possible at every stage.
              END_PARAGRAPH
            end
            para do <<-END_PARAGRAPH
              I have tried to piggy-back programming concepts onto concepts
              the new programmer already has; to present ideas in such a way
              that their intuition will carry the load, rather than the
              tutorial.  Object-Oriented programming lends itself to this
              quite well.  I was able to begin referring to "objects" and
              different "kinds of objects" pretty early in the tutorial,
              slipping those phrases in at the most innocent of moments.
              I wasn't saying anything like "everything in Ruby is an
              object," or "numbers and strings are kinds of objects,"
              because these statements really don't mean anything to
              a new programmer.  Instead, I would talk about strings
              (not "string objects"), and sometimes I would refer to
              "objects", simply meaning "the things in these programs."
              The fact that all these <em>things</em> in Ruby <em>are</em> objects
              made this sort of sneakiness on my part work so well.

              Although I wanted to avoid needless OO jargon, I wanted
              to make sure that, if they did need to learn a word, they
              learned the right one.  (I don't want them to have to learn
              it twice, right?)  So I called them "strings," not "text."  Methods
              needed to be called something, so I called them "methods."

              As far as the exercises are concerned, I think I came up
              with some good ones, but you can never have too many.
              Honestly, I bet I spent half of my time just trying to
              come up with fun, interesting exercises.
              Boring exercises absolutely kill any desire
              to program, while the perfect exercise creates an itch
              the new programmer can't help but scratch.  In short,
              you just can't spend too much time coming up with good
              exercises.

              The pages of the tutorial (and even this page) are generated by a
              <a href="#{LINKADDR}?ShowTutorialCode=true">big Ruby program</a>,
              of course.  :-)
              As such, it has some neat features.  For example, all of the
              code samples are actually being run every time you view
              the page, and the output shown is the output they generate.
              I think this is the best, easiest, and
              certainly the coolest way to make sure that all of the
              code I present works <em>exactly</em> as I say it does.
              You don't have to worry that I might have copied the output
              of one of the examples
              wrong, or forgotten to test some of the code; it's all tested
              every time you see it.  So in the section on random number
              generators, if you reload the page you will see the numbers
              change each time... <em>nice</em>.
              (I used a similar trick for the example code when writing
              the book, but it's obviously more apparent with the tutorial.)
